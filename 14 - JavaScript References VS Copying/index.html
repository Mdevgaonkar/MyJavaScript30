    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    const playersCopy = players;
    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    console.log(players, playersCopy);
    // however what happens when we update that array?
    players[2] = 'Edd';
    // now here is the problem!
    console.log(players, playersCopy);
    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    playersCopy1 = players.splice();
    console.log(players, playersCopy1);
    players[2] = 'Duke';
    console.log(players, playersCopy1);
    // one way
    
    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    playersCopy2 = [].concat(players);
    console.log(players, playersCopy2);
    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    playersCopy3 = [...players];
    console.log(players, playersCopy3);

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    const me = person;
    me.name = 'Mayur';
    me.age = 23;
    console.log(person,me);
    

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const newMe = Object.assign({},person,{name:'Dev Mayur',age:24});
    console.log(person,newMe);

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    
    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
    const dev = {
      name:'Dev',
      age:24,
      gitRepos:{
        name:'blah blah',
        commits: 40
        }
      }

    const newDev = Object.assign({}, dev,{gitRepos:{name:'fuu fuu'}});
    console.log(newDev);
    
    newDev.gitRepos.name='duh duh';
    console.log(newDev);

    //well we tested and found deep assign happens with assign
